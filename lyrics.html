Some days I don't know where my mind goes
Horoscope says that I'm psycho
Nothing to fill up my film rolls
Spend all my time on my pillow

And I don't know how to listen to my friends
They say I need a night, to forget
But I think I'll just surrender to my bed
'Cause I need a night in my head
Nobody gets to know me
Guess I've been living low key
Lately I've been putting out the read receipts
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody

Nobody gets the old me
No need to touch my car keys
Lately I just follow all my friends' stories
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody

Some days I don't know where the time goes
Sleeping 'til two is my Bible
Lost in the internet black hole
Thinking 'bout you was a typo

And I don't know how to listen to my friends
They say I need a night, to forget
But I think I'll just surrender to my bed
'Cause I need a night in my head

Nobody gets to know me
Guess I've been living low key
Lately I've been putting out the read receipts
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody
Nobody gets the old me
No need to touch my car keys
Lately I just follow all my friends' stories
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody

If I leave my room tonight
And I don't know where I'm going
Would you wanna hang tonight?
I could drive you in the morning
Nobody gets to know me
Guess I've been living low key
Lately, lately, lately I've been feeling like a homebody
Nobody gets the old me

No need to touch my car keys
Lately I just follow all my friends' stories
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody

If I leave my room tonight
And I don't know where I'm going
Would you wanna hang tonight?
I could drive you in the morning
Nobody gets to know me
Guess I've been living low key
Lately I just follow all my friends stories
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody
